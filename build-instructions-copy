Instructions for changing the Square API key doing the build and restarting the server

1. Log into the server as root
	This assumes you have alread6y set up an ssh connection
	ssh root@167.99.40.102
	
2. Edit the properties file
	cd ~/ssa/shopify-square-automation/src/main/resources
	
	change the value of configuration.square.access
	save and edit
	
3. Kill the running application
	ps -ef | grep java
	
	find the entry for the jar file. It will look something lie this:
	dean	11661	10161	2	13:24	pts/0	00:00:14 java -jar target/shopify-square-automation-=0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
	
	In the above line the process id is the second column (11661). You need to kill that process. Type:
	kill -15 11661 (using your process id of course
	
	wait 10 seconds and run
	ps -ef | grep java
	
	to confirm the process is gone.
	
	If you see something like this, it's probably a good idea to wait a couple of seconds and check again. I don't think it matters, but...
	
	[1]+ Exit 143
	
4. Do the build		

	cd ~/ssa/shopify-square-automation
	rm -fr target/
	mvn clean install
	
   Confirm the build
	ls -l target/shopify-square-automation-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
	(check the timestamp - probably GMT time)
	
5.	Start the server
	this is the bare command: java -jar target/shopify-square-automation-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
	but use the following instead to run it in the background so you can log out and leave it running
	
	nohup java -jar target/shopify-square-automation-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar >/dev/null 2>&1 &
